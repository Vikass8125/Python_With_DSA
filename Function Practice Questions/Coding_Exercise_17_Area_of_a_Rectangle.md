# Coding Exercise 17: Area of a Rectangle

## Problem Description:
You are given the length and breadth of a rectangle. Your task is to compute and return the area of the rectangle.

### Formula:
To calculate the area of a rectangle:  
**Area = length × breadth**

---

## Input:
Two floating-point numbers, `length` and `breadth`, representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

---

## Output:
A floating-point number representing the area of the rectangle.

---

## Example:

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`length = 5`, `breadth = 3`  
**Output:**  
`15.0`  

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`length = 7.5`, `breadth = 2.4`  
**Output:**  
`18.0`  

---

## Solution:

### Code:
```python
def area_of_rectangle(length, breadth):
    """
    Function to calculate the area of a rectangle.
    
    Parameters:
    length (float): The length of the rectangle.
    breadth (float): The breadth of the rectangle.
    
    Returns:
    float: The area of the rectangle.
    """
    # Multiply length by breadth to get the area of the rectangle
    return length * breadth
```

---

## Explanation:

### Problem Breakdown:
The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its breadth. This is a straightforward operation that involves one multiplication.

### Steps:
1. Accept two floating-point numbers, `length` and `breadth`, as input.
2. Use the formula:  
   **Area = length × breadth**
3. Return the calculated area as a floating-point number.

## Example Walkthrough:

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`length = 5`, `breadth = 3`  

**Step 1:** Use the formula:  
`Area = 5 × 3`  
**Step 2:** Calculate:  
`Area = 15.0`  

**Output:**  
`15.0`

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`length = 7.5`, `breadth = 2.4`  

**Step 1:** Use the formula:  
`Area = 7.5 × 2.4`  
**Step 2:** Calculate:  
`Area = 18.0`  

**Output:**  
`18.0`

---

## Edge Cases:
1. **Zero as Input:**  
   If either `length` or `breadth` is `0`, the area will be `0.0`.  
   Example:  
   `length = 0`, `breadth = 5`  
   Output: `0.0`  

2. **Negative Dimensions:**  
   If negative values are passed as input, the result will still calculate using the same formula.  
   However, negative dimensions might not make sense in real-world applications. You could add a validation step to ensure that `length` and `breadth` are non-negative.

---

## Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity:
- **O(1):** The formula involves a single multiplication operation.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1):** No extra space is used beyond the input variables.

---

## Summary:
This problem demonstrates the fundamental concept of calculating the area of a rectangle. It emphasizes using basic arithmetic and is a good exercise for learning how to implement formulas in code.
