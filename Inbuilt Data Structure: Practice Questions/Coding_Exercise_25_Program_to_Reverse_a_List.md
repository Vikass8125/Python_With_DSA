# Reverse a List (Non-Slicing Approach)

## Problem Statement
You are given a list of integers. Write a Python program that reverses the list without using slicing (`lst[::-1]`). The program should return the reversed list.

### Parameters:
- `lst` (List of integers): The list of integers to be reversed.

### Returns:
- A list of integers where the order of elements is reversed from the input list.

### Example:

#### Example 1:
**Input:**
```python
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
**Output:**
```
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

#### Example 2:
**Input:**
```python
lst = [10, 20, 30, 40]
```
**Output:**
```
[40, 30, 20, 10]
```

## Explanation
The goal is to reverse the order of elements in the input list without using Python's slicing feature (`lst[::-1]`). Instead, we use two pointers:
1. One pointer starts at the beginning of the list.
2. The other pointer starts at the end of the list.

We repeatedly swap the elements at these two pointers and move the pointers closer to each other until they meet in the middle.

---

## Solution
We will solve this problem using a two-pointer approach, which ensures an in-place reversal of the list with minimal space usage.

### Implementation:
```python
def reverse_list(lst):
    # Initialize two pointers: one at the beginning, one at the end
    start = 0
    end = len(lst) - 1
    
    # Swap elements until the two pointers meet in the middle
    while start < end:
        # Swap the elements at the start and end pointers
        lst[start], lst[end] = lst[end], lst[start]
        # Move the pointers towards the middle
        start += 1
        end -= 1
    
    # Return the reversed list
    return lst

# Example Usage:
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(reverse_list(lst))  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

---

## Code Walkthrough
1. **Initialization**:
   - Define two pointers: `start` at the beginning of the list (`0`) and `end` at the last index of the list (`len(lst) - 1`).
2. **Swap Logic**:
   - Use a `while` loop to check if `start` is less than `end`.
   - Swap the elements at `start` and `end` using tuple unpacking.
   - Increment `start` by 1 and decrement `end` by 1.
3. **Return Result**:
   - Once the loop completes, return the modified list as the reversed list.

---

## Complexity Analysis
### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: The loop iterates through half the list, performing a constant-time swap operation for each pair of elements.

### Space Complexity
- **O(1)**: The reversal is done in place without using any additional data structures.

---

## Alternative Solutions
While the two-pointer approach is efficient, here are two other ways to reverse a list:

### Using a Temporary List
Copy elements from the original list into a new list in reverse order.
```python
def reverse_list(lst):
    reversed_list = []
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1, -1, -1):
        reversed_list.append(lst[i])
    return reversed_list
```
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) (due to the temporary list).

### Using Recursion
Reverse the list by recursively swapping elements.
```python
def reverse_list_recursive(lst, start, end):
    if start >= end:
        return lst
    lst[start], lst[end] = lst[end], lst[start]
    return reverse_list_recursive(lst, start + 1, end - 1)

# Example Usage:
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(reverse_list_recursive(lst, 0, len(lst) - 1))  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) (due to recursive call stack).

---

## Summary
The two-pointer approach is the most efficient way to reverse a list in place, with an `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity. For scenarios where memory usage is not a concern, other methods like creating a temporary list or using recursion can also be considered.
